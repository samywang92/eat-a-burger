# eat-a-burger
This is a simple waiting system called Wait-a-Burger.  A cashier is able to add orders to the table and mark it as served after it has been ordered.
What-a-Burger stores orders onto a SQL database to allow continuity if one was to refresh the page.  
It also uses a RESTful API, handlebars, and a MVC setup.
